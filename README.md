Miscellaneous code challenges with varying levels of attention to detail. 

Nearly all written using vim + chrome devtools on a 13" macbook. The limited screen space affects my style.

Recently had multiple groups in a row say my work is hard to read. One even thought the work was generated/minified (not sure by what) until I did the same thing with css in an interview. I typically run vim scripts against my files before committing to fit whatever prevailing expectations exist in a given environment, but that's not the case here.
